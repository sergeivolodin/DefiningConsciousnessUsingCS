\title{Philosophy of Life Sciences.\\ Definition of consciousness (Computer Science part)}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this essay, a question of whether or not artificial consciousness is possible is addressed.
Despite this enormous efforts, the definition seemed to slip through our fingers, and there is no unified theory still.
On the other hand, during the past fifty years, a number of significant breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence allowed to answer a few questions about what consciousness {\em is not}.
Another part of these breakthroughs is the Integrated information theory, which gives a set of necessary properties required for a physical system to be conscious.

\section{Introduction}
Plan:\begin{enumerate}
\item Thesis
\item Definitions: Consciousness meta-definition. Hard problem consciousness. Artificial consciousness
\item Why is artificial consciousness important. AI safety, superintelligence. Solving other problems by AI. Ethics for RL.
\item Argument. Support for argument
\item Analysis of definitions which do not support this claim.
\item ---
\item Problems with existing definitions. Problems with artificial systems.
\item Consciousness as part of the brain
\item Artificial general intelligence recent attempts. RL. Are they conscious?
\item Consciousness as a part of AGI
\item Theories of consciousness
\item Integrated Information Theory
\item Question: can artificial consciousness exist? Argue that yes.
\item Question: 1 bit input to consciousness. Can a creature be conscious? Argue that yes. Use different definitions to support this claim
\end{enumerate}
In this (part of an) essay the existence of an artificial consciousness is being proven. The main problem of answering to this question is that there is no consensus on what a natural consciousness is. Various definitions of consciousness based on recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence are used.

{\bf Below: list of possible ideas}

Assumptions:
1. World has a lot of problems
2. Developing AGI is a good idea to solve at least part of them, by gaining insignt on the go, or by deploying AGI
3. Consciousness is a big part of AGI
4. Therefore, trying to build artificial consciousness is an important problem
5. We don't know what is consciousness
6. We don't know what is artificial consciousness
7. Since artificial consciousness is an engineering task, we need to understand what consciousness is to build it.
8. To do so, we examine existing definitions and look at how existing ones allow to build it, and why other ones say that it's impossible

Points:
1. Artificial consciousness can exist
2. Consciousness can be explained using information theory and other topics of Computer Science
3. Easy problem (behavior) can be explained as computation

What am I looking for?
If Blue Brain project claims itâ€™s conscious. Is it? Need a good definition
0. Some structure (theory) in theory of learning/information theory need to learn/compute = consciousness?
1. Definition which explains which parts are required for a system to be conscious
2. Explain why hard problem (experience) exist
3. What about information processing?
4. What about action selection?
5. What about learning?
6. What about language?


Problem with Turing test: since we don't know what is intelligence, we don't know how it should behave. Monkeys have same possibility (or uneducated human has roughly the same ability to learn), but he wouldn't notice differences and "wrong speaking/actions" of a machine. Need a series of Turing tests with winner judging next? Need a consensus? 

All of the human qualities can be imitated. Does it make the creature intelligent? Is sort of infinity required?

How can I choose something with consciousness without using words? How does it encode choice indices? What is the maximal \#choices?

Can have qualia of 1 bit?
Turing test: only behavior. Allows for a philosophical zombie.
